Phantom Sensors
===============

This is a repository of common tcollector collectors (sensors) that are intended
to be used with the [Phantom project](http://http://www.nimbusproject.org/doc/phantom/).

It follows the conventions defined for the [tcollector collectors directory](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector).

Configuration for your collectors can be put into etc, common library code in lib,
and all collectors can be placed into the 0 directory. 

For more information on using sensors with Phantom, please see:
